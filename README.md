- Node.js & npm
- Docker (optional)

### Quick Start (Windows)
The easiest way to get started is to use the included batch script:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `run.bat` from the project root.
3. The dashboard will automatically open at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Manual Setup

#### Backend
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
Backend runs on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

#### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Frontend runs on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### Running with Docker
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
- Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Backend API: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## 📂 Project Structure

- `/backend`: FastAPI application, database logic, and file storage simulation.
- `/frontend`: React dashboard application.
- `/docker-compose.yml`: Container orchestration for easy deployment.
- `run.bat`: One-click launcher for Windows environments.

## 🛡️ Verification
Each component features a `verify.py` script to ensure data integrity and system consistency. Check the dashboard logs for real-time validation status.
